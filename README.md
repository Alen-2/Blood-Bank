<h1> Blood-Bridge</h1>
<p>Blood-Bridge is a mobile application developed to facilitate the efficient matching of blood donors with receivers using a bipartite maximal matching algorithm. The primary objective of the application is to ensure that the maximum number of people in need of blood receive timely assistance, while also suggesting the best possible donation centre, based on proximity to both the donor and the receiver.</p>

Features:
<li>Users(donors and receivers), hospitals, and blood banks can register in the app.</li>
<li>Users can set their status to donor, receiver or not available.</li>
<li>Hospitals and blood banks can view the details of all the donations that are matched at their center.</li>
<li>Users can view the details of the matched user and the matched center.</li>
<li>For more details, please refer to the presentation and the sections below.</li>

<h1>Steps to run this project</h1>
<p>
  To run the Blood-Bridge app, follow these steps:

<li>Install and set up Flutter on your PC. You can find the installation guide on the Flutter website.

<li>Create a Firebase project and connect it with the app. Go to the Firebase website and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. Once you're logged in, create a new project and follow the instructions to connect it with the Blood-Bridge app.

<li>Run MatchingScript.py after giving the correct path of the credential file downloaded from the Firebase project. To do this, open the script in a Python editor and change the path of the credential file to the location where you saved it on your PC. Then, run the script to match donors with receivers.

Once these steps are completed, you should be able to run the Blood-Bridge app on your PC. If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help.
